# .dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository. The repository needs to be installed directly within the $HOME directory of a macOS environment.

---

## Install

### .dotfiles

Requires SSH to work, see [SSH](#SSH).

Clone the .dotfiles as bare repository within your $HOME directory

	git clone --bare git@github.com:avanthay/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

Create the alias `dot` to use instead of git for handling with your .dotfiles

	alias dot='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME'

**Backup the existing files** which will be overridden with the ones of this repo, checkout the current version and set the upsteam for the local branch `master`

	dot checkout

Update the local repository config to hide untracked files when doing `dot status`

	dot config status.showUntrackedFiles no

Initialize and update the submodules

	dot submodule update --init --recursive

Set your git credentials by copying `.gitconfig.local.sample` to `.gitconfig.local` and editing it

It may be a good idea to reboot your mac.

### Setup a new Mac

Set the hostname in `System preferences` > `Sharing`

Disable Guest Account in `System preferences` > `Users and Groups`

Enable harddisk encryption and the Firewall in `System preferences` > `Security and Confidentiality`

Check the remaining `System preferences`, maybe check the screenshots at `.dot/config/macOS`
